# Favicon Cache Fix

The favicon has been updated, but browsers heavily cache favicons. Here's how to see the new favicon:

## 🔄 Clear Browser Cache

### Chrome/Edge:

1. Press `Ctrl+Shift+R` (Windows) or `Cmd+Shift+R` (Mac) to hard refresh
2. Or go to Developer Tools (F12) → Network tab → check "Disable cache"
3. Or clear browser cache: Settings → Privacy → Clear browsing data

### Firefox:

1. Press `Ctrl+F5` (Windows) or `Cmd+Shift+R` (Mac)
2. Or go to Developer Tools (F12) → Network tab → check "Disable cache"

### Safari:

1. Press `Cmd+Option+R`
2. Or go to Develop menu → Empty Caches

## 🎯 Alternative Methods

### Method 1: Incognito/Private Mode

- Open your portfolio in an incognito/private window
- The new favicon should appear immediately

### Method 2: Different Browser

- Try opening your portfolio in a different browser
- The new favicon should appear

### Method 3: Direct URL

- Visit: `http://localhost:3000/favicon.ico` directly
- This should show the new favicon

## ✅ What's Been Updated

1. **Custom SVG Favicon**: Created with "SM" initials and gradient design
2. **New favicon.ico**: Generated programmatically with custom design
3. **Cache-busting parameters**: Added `?v=2` to force reload
4. **Cache control headers**: Added meta tags to prevent caching

## 🔍 Verify the Fix

After clearing cache, you should see:

- A circular gradient favicon (blue to purple)
- "SM" initials in white
- Consistent across all browser tabs

## 🚀 Production Deployment

When you deploy to production:

1. The favicon will work immediately for new visitors
2. Existing visitors may need to clear their cache
3. The cache-busting parameters will help with updates

The favicon is now properly set up and should display correctly once the browser cache is cleared!
