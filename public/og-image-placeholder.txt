# Open Graph Image Placeholder

To complete the SEO setup, you need to create an og-image.png file (1200x630px) for social media sharing.

You can:
1. Take a screenshot of the og-image.html file in your browser
2. Use the HTML file as a template to create the image
3. Use online tools like Canva or Figma to create a similar design

The image should include:
- Your name: "Syed Muqeet Aqib"
- Your title: "Full Stack Developer & Blockchain Engineer"
- A brief description
- Your brand colors (gradient background)
- Professional styling

Save the image as "og-image.png" in the public folder.
